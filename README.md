2. [Zig Bits 0x4: Building an HTTP client/server from scratch](https://blog.orhun.dev/zig-bits-04/)
3. [Writing a struct deserializer with Zig metaprogramming](https://nathancraddock.com/blog/deserialization-with-zig-metaprogramming/)
4. [Fahrenheit To Celsius](https://zig.guide/posts/fahrenheit-to-celsius)
5. [A Guessing Game](https://zig.guide/posts/a-guessing-game)
6. [Zig Bits 0x1: Returning slices from functions](https://blog.orhun.dev/zig-bits-01/)
7. [Zig Bits 0x2: Using defer to defeat memory leaks](https://blog.orhun.dev/zig-bits-02/)

I then plan to work my way through the Zig Cookbook and Ziglings:
- [Zig Cookbook](https://cookbook.ziglang.cc/)
- [Ziglings](https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises)

Then, if I still need to learn more, I'll work through these books:
- [Introduction to Zig: a project-based book](https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/)
- [Learning Zig](https://www.openmymind.net/learning_zig/)

I'll also probably want to go through [zig.guide](https://zig.guide) at some point.
